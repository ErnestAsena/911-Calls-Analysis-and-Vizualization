# 911-Calls-Analysis-and-Vizualization
In this notebook, I go through the 911 calls dataset available on kaggle and perform basic analysis and vizualizations to answer questions like; When are most calls made? What are the reasons stated for most calls? What days are most of the calls made? What areas have most calls come from?
